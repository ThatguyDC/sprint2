                    <ul>Originally, games on a computer started off as a simple depiction of input movement, such as Pong. Things rapidly developed from there, introducing moving backgrounds, enemies, basic mechanics, and more in arcade-style games like Galaga or Centipede. Eventually, 3D games began to take over the scene, gaining massive popuarity through iteration from Mario, Zelda, and more. Destiny, Call of Duty, Minecraft, League of Legends, and a near infinite amount of games currently dominate the market, though all of these innovations call back to the original principles of games that were thought up all those decades ago. </ul>

                    <ul>Communities in gaming come in all sizes and in diverse ranges of people. For example in the photo to the right, a League of Legends tournament is taking place, with thousands of fans cheering either team that's competing. While it's not neccesarily a large event compared to things like the Super Bowl or the World Cup, there are millions of fans that you can't see watching from home, in class, at work, and more. After the tournament, the experience doesn't end. Players can go and replicate what they saw their favorite players doing in-game with their friends, and spend days on end telling stories about their favorite moments. That's what the communities in gaming are all about. </ul>

For example, Microsoft recently purchased ABK, better known as Activistion-Blizzard, for around $70 Billion, proving the long-term viability of games created by large studios, and of the industry in general. </ul>
