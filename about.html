                    <p>Hi, I’m Sam Sweeney. I am from Cincinnati Ohio. I am a Games and Sims Major and I plan to go into game art. I have used many programs such as 3ds max, blender, photoshop, aftereffects, AutoCAD, and SketchUp. I am currently learning to use Illustrator and Game Maker studio 2. I have learned how to use Html, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript. I like to collect video games. I have over 15 consoles and a Packman arcade cabinet. I also have 4 copies of Star Wars Battle Front 2 (classic 2005) for the PS2, PSP, Xbox and PC. I have one copy for every platform.</p>

                    <p>My name is Kendall Haberman and I am from Cleveland, Ohio. I am the youngest of three and enjoy spending time with my sisters and my parents. I love dogs and going to the beach to watch the sunset. I like to go out to eat with my friends, especially going to the restaurant Barrio or taking a trip to Starbucks. I was a dancer for 15 years before I came to college, and hope to continue to find a way to dance here too. I also enjoy going to the gym and listening to music. I went to Strongsville High School, where I took part in cheer, dance, Environment Club, and National Honors Society. I graduated high school with honors and plan to accomplish the same thing here at Miami University. I am an Emerging Technology in Business and Design major here, and am learning so much everyday. I am in the honors college and have enjoyed my time here greatly. I want to end up with a job as a social media marketer, or something in that field. I want to connect to others with my work and am looking forward to the places this major can take me.</p>

                    <p>Hi! My name is Davis Cowper, a Games and Simulation major at Miami University with a focus on development and heavy interest in production. I’ve worked on various projects such as my personal website, a sidescroller minigame, and a pinball prototype. I initially found interest in games at a young age, starting off with the DS and the Wii. I eventually graduated from games such as Wii Sports Resort and Pokemon to Minecraft, Halo, and more on Xbox. Eventually, I became obsessed with Destiny, the newly born child of Bungie’s development team in 2014. I played on and off until about 2019, where I became a hardcore, almost professional player of the game, completing endgame content and challenges routinely. This love and passion brought me to where I am today, attempting to learn the intricacies of development and production in order to deliver that same love and passion of video games to players around the world. In addition to my love of games, I am a mentor in Kode2Learn, a club at Miami University which mentors and teaches elementary age students about the fundamentals of computer science and technology. This experience has helped me grow to understand the challenges of teaching, and developed the ability to assist in challenging academic situations, such as large group development projects or design research. I have a diverse set of skills and talents that would be useful to anyone who needs an organized, knowledgeable, and passionate individual to aid in development, junior mentorship, or principled design work.</p>
